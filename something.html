  <h1>
    UPASANA PRUSTY
  </h1>
  <hr>
  <p> I create this website solely for the one and only, UPASANA</p>
  <p>I decided to create this small website when I saw Gayatri di and Jessica di's Instagram story. Whihc also made me question wether someone had wised you a happy valentines day!</p>
  <p>It is currently 02:11 in the morning of Valentine's day</p>
  <p>The sole purpose of the above line was to tell how much of a night owl I am and to tell how much I care for your well being (sike)(double sike i do care about you...)</p>
  <p>Jokes apart this website gives you a tour around a small town called UPASANAVILL from MY perspective</p>
